      Readiness probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's
      lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. A `readinessProbe` is used by Services
      and Deployments to determine if the Pod is ready to receive network traffic.
      This policy validates that all containers have one of readinessProbe,
      startupProbe defined. In addition, CPU and memory resource requests and limits are validated with
      with this policy.
